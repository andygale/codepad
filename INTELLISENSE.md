# IntelliSense Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Context-aware auto-completion and error detection for Kotlin and Java has been successfully implemented using Language Server Protocol (LSP) integration via a dedicated LSP Gateway service.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### IntelliSense Features
- **Auto-completion**: Smart code suggestions with `Ctrl+Space` or automatic triggers
- **Error detection**: Real-time syntax and semantic error highlighting with red squiggles
- **Hover information**: Type definitions, documentation, and signatures on hover
- **Diagnostics**: Live problem detection with error/warning markers
- **Collaborative**: IntelliSense state synchronized across all users in real-time

### Language Support
- **Kotlin**: Full LSP support via Kotlin Language Server (KLS)
- **Java**: Full LSP support via Eclipse JDT Language Server
- **Status Indicator**: Visual indicator showing IntelliSense connection status

## 🏗️ Architecture

### New LSP Gateway Architecture
The IntelliSense implementation has been completely rewritten using a modern, containerized architecture:

1. **LSP Gateway Service** (`lsp-gateway` Docker container)
   - Dedicated Go-based LSP gateway service
   - Hosts shared Kotlin and Java language server processes
   - Provides WebSocket endpoints for each language
   - Independent health monitoring and auto-recovery

2. **Simple WebSocket Proxy** (`server/src/index.js`)
   - Lightweight 58-line proxy implementation
   - Routes browser LSP traffic to the gateway service
   - Enforces room pause checks
   - Handles client connection lifecycle

3. **LSP Client** (`client/src/services/lspClient.ts`)
   - Monaco Editor integration with WebSocket transport
   - LSP protocol handling on client side
   - Completion, hover, and diagnostics providers
   - Deferred didOpen handling to prevent race conditions

4. **Monaco Integration** (`client/src/Room.tsx`)
   - Automatic LSP connection based on language selection
   - Visual status indicators and marker management
   - Seamless integration with existing editor

### Key Improvements
- **🚀 Simplified**: 58 lines vs 1500+ lines of legacy proxy code
- **🐳 Containerized**: Language servers run in isolated Docker container
- **🔧 Reliable**: Fixed race conditions and connection issues
- **📈 Scalable**: Independent service scaling and health monitoring

## 📦 Installation & Usage

### Development Setup
```bash
# Install all dependencies
yarn install:all

# Start development server (includes LSP gateway via Docker)
yarn dev
```

### Production Build
```bash
# Build for production
yarn build

# Start production server
yarn start
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose (includes LSP gateway)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up --build
```

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Service Startup**: LSP Gateway container starts with dedicated language servers
2. **Language Detection**: When user selects Kotlin or Java, LSP client connects via WebSocket
3. **Proxy Routing**: Main server proxies LSP traffic to gateway service
4. **Real-time Sync**: All IntelliSense features work collaboratively across multiple users
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and connection recovery

### LSP Message Flow
```
Monaco Editor ↔ LSP Client ↔ WebSocket ↔ Main Server Proxy ↔ LSP Gateway ↔ Language Server
```

## 🎮 User Experience

### Visual Indicators
- **Green dot**: IntelliSense connected and active
- **Orange dot**: IntelliSense connecting/loading
- **Red squiggles**: Real-time error highlighting
- **No indicator**: Language not supported for IntelliSense

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Ctrl+Space` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Space` (Mac): Trigger completion
- `Hover`: Show type information and documentation
- `Real-time`: Error highlighting as you type

## 🚀 Performance

### Resource Usage
- **LSP Gateway Container**: ~2GB RAM (hosts both language servers)
- **Main Server**: Minimal overhead (lightweight proxy)
- **Shared Process**: Single language server instance per language
- **Auto-scaling**: Gateway service scales independently

### Optimization Features
- Containerized language server isolation
- Efficient WebSocket message routing
- Monaco Editor performance optimizations
- Race condition prevention in LSP client

## 🔒 Security

- Language servers run in isolated Docker container
- No file system access outside container workspace
- Network isolation via Docker networking
- Input sanitization and validation
- Room pause enforcement at proxy level

## 📊 Status & Monitoring

Check LSP Gateway status:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/healthz
```

Check main server status:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/info
```

Response includes:
- Service health status
- Container connectivity
- Supported languages
- Active connections
